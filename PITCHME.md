## The early days of Virtualization:

#### 1964 / 1965: CP-40 and IBM System/360-67

CP-40 was a revolutionary research operating system that supported virtual machines, virtual memory and more.  Both CP-40 and

The early days of Virtualization on hardware that is affordable by mere mortals.

@ul[circles]
- 1994: Bochs
- 1997: Virtual PC
- 1999: VMWare Virtual Platform
- 2003: First release of Xen
- 2007: First release of KVM, integrated with the Linux kernel, requires hardware support.
- 2007: First release of VirtualBox

## Trap and Emulate Virtualization

x86 processors have different "protection rings".

@ul[circles]
- Ring 0 can do anything it wants with hardware
- Ring 3 can crash at any time without impacting anything else.
- Ring 1 & 2 are almost never used. @note[There are other rings, but those only come into play if we turn this into a security talk.]

Note:

- This presents a problem for running a virtualized guest, if it wants to write to video memory it needs Ring 0 access but is running in ring 3.
- Typically 10x slower than bare meta.
- Slow, hacky and complex.

## Intel Virtualization Technologies

@ul[circles]
- 2006 - Intel VT-x
- 2008 - Intel EPT
- 2009 - Intel VT-d
- 2013 - Intel APICv
- 2012 - SR-IOV
@ulend

Note:

- EPT was first available on Desktop CPU's, EPT and VT-d arrived on Xeon CPU's with the Nehalem architecture.

2006 Hardware Virtualization came to intel

## Hardware-assisted virtualization

Intel (VT-x) and AMD (AMD-V) introduced in 2006

Note:

- Used by hypervisor to handle privileged intructions, they add new instructions that permit entering and exiting a virtual execution mode where the guest OS perceives itself as running with full privilege (ring 0), but the host OS remains protected.

## Virtual Memory

@endul

Note:

- Modern Operating Systems manage translating
- Modern Operating Systems use a combination of hardware MMU and software to map the virtual addresses of processes onto the physical addresses of the computers memory.


---

## MMU Virtualization

* Extended Page Tables
* Rapid Virtualization Indexing

Note:

- Virtualized MMU for the Guest OS, so the host OS doesn't have to manage shadow page tables. 

---


## Interrupt virtualization and I/O MMU virtualization 


Note:

- This is PCI passthrough
- This allows things like network and video passthrough to guest VM's

---

## SR-IOV

Note:

- This allows a PCIe device to be carved up and divied out to multipe VM's
- Each VM can have a physical network card
- Each VM can have part of a GPU (Tesla)

---

## Linux and KVM

```
cat /proc/cmdline
BOOT_IMAGE=/vmlinuz-4.15.15-200.fc26.x86_64 root=/dev/mapper/basevg-root ro rd.driver.pre=vfio-pci pci-stub.ids=10de:1bb1,10de:10f0,6549:2200 nouveau.modeset=0 rd.blacklist=nouveau modprobe.blacklist=nouveau iommu=pt intel_iommu=on rd.lvm.lv=basevg/root
```

Note:

- If you are passing through an NVIDIA ard, you need to disable the nouveau driver

---

## IOMMU and Linux

```
intel_iommu=on
iommu=pt
```

Note:

- iommu=pt is iommu = pass through.  disable Dynamic DMA remapping in the linux kernel.
- The pt option only enables IOMMU for devices used in passthrough and will provide better host performance.

## Kill Nouveau

```
cat /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau.conf
blacklist nouveau
options nouveau modeset=0
```

@note[ nouveau is the open source NVIDIA driver, it is great if you are a purist, but not good if you want to play games, mine bitcoin or get work done. ]
